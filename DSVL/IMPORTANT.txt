IMPORTANT INFORMATION
====================

*DO NOT* compile DSVL and your application with DIFFERENT C/C++ runtime
libraries (e.g. "Multithreaded" and "Multithreaded DLL"), as this would
result in memory corruption and "crtIsValidHeapPointer" exceptions.

Make sure you have Microsoft's DirectX 9.0 SDK (April 2005) and
Extras Package (February 2005) installed. The $(DXSDK_DIR)
environment variable should point to your SDK root directory.
Put the Extras package into $(DXSDK_DIR)\Extras.

DSVL links against strmbase.lib (Release) and strmbasd.lib (Debug) which
DO NOT come with the SDK in binary form. Use the following workspace
to build those libraries:
$(DXSDK_DIR)\Extras\DirectShow\Samples\C++\DirectShow\BaseClasses\baseclasses.sln
